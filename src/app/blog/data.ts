### **Equality Theories Explored by Amartya Sen**

In his paper "Equality of What?" by Amartya Sen, he delves into three different conceptions of equality, examining their strengths and limitations while proposing an alternative formulation termed "basic capability equality." Sen presents this framework as a more nuanced and comprehensive approach to the concept of equality.

#### **I. Methodological Approaches to Critiquing Equality [217, 198]**
Sen begins by discussing two distinct methodological approaches, the case-implication critique and the prior-principle critique, to evaluate and analyze moral claims associated with different conceptions of equality.

#### **II. Critique of Rawlsian Equality [215]**
Exploring Rawlsian equality, Sen highlights its reliance on two principles of justice. While it prioritizes fundamental liberties and necessitates efficiency combined with equality, it permits inequalities only if they benefit the worst-off. Sen argues that despite addressing some limitations of utilitarian and total utility equality, Rawlsian equality falls short. He points out its potential oversight of the diverse needs of individuals, particularly those with disabilities or disadvantages.

**Hypothetical Scenario:** Sen uses the example of two workers to illustrate his critique of Rawlsian equality. Worker A, physically able, is compared with Worker B, who has a longstanding medical condition requiring substantial healthcare expenses. The Rawlsian model of equality, focusing on equal opportunities, income, and wealth (primary goods), overlooks the added struggles faced by Worker B due to their medical situation, creating considerable differences in their realistic capabilities.

#### **III. Proposal of Basic Capability Equality**
In response to the limitations identified in other equality models, Sen introduces the concept of basic capability equality. This approach emphasizes individuals' fundamental capabilities such as mobility, meeting nutritional requirements, and participation in social life. Sen advocates for a shift in focus from mere utility or primary goods towards what individuals can achieve, considering the diversity among people.

**Critiques and Responses:** Critics like Charles Gore question Sen's emphasis on individual effective freedom, highlighting its potential neglect of important social and communal values. Another critique pertains to the vagueness of Sen's emphasis on individual freedom and its societal impact, especially in balancing freedoms that might harm the broader society.

#### **IV. Sen's Conclusion**
Sen concludes that utilitarian equality, total utility equality, and Rawlsian equality exhibit limitations in providing a comprehensive theory of equality. He posits that basic capability equality stands out as a more inclusive and refined approach, considering the diversity among individuals and emphasizing their basic capabilities.

# Introduction to the Capability Approach

The capability approach, as explicated by Ingrid Robeyns, unfolds as an evaluative framework emphasizing what people are able to be and do (Robeyns 2005). It contrasts starkly with welfarist and utility-based paradigms by concentrating on individuals' capabilities and functionings rather than their happiness or material possessions. This normative viewpoint derives from influential work by Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum, each infusing the approach with different emphases and objectives—Sen with a focus on freedoms and functionings, and Nussbaum advocating for a distinct list of essential capabilities (Robeyns 2005).

# Advantages of the Capability Approach

The approach is lauded for its commitment to accommodating human diversity, embedding personal, social, and environmental conversion factors that affect an individual's abilities to convert commodities into functionings. It's these unique conversion factors and the distinction between achieved functionings and individual freedoms that furnish depth to the debate on well-being and justice (Robeyns 2005, p. 94-95).

# The Emphasis on Diverse Conceptions of a Good Life

A significant part of the approach involves respecting individuals' diverse conceptions of a good life, claiming that capabilities, not achieved functionings, should be the ultimate focus of political agendas, since they encapsulate personal freedoms. This emphasis on capability over functioning echoes liberal philosophical ideals, valuing individual freedoms while acknowledging their embeddedness in social fabrics (Robeyns 2005, p. 107).

# Criticisms and Challenges of the Capability Approach

However, the capability approach has recently undergone criticism regarding its presumed individualism and the methods for establishing relevant capabilities (Robeyns 2005, p. 107). Sen, resisting the idea of a fixed capability list, asserts these should emerge from democratic processes. This stance provokes inquiries about the practicalities of such processes, especially in contexts where true democratic deliberations seem implausible or insufficient (Robeyns 2005, p. 101-102).

Upon careful analysis, one finds that Sen's reluctance for a predetermined list can lead to methodological ambiguities, potentially compromising the approach's ability to effectively guide policy. Without a specified set of capabilities, comparisons across individuals or societies might be problematic, diluting the approach's prescriptive power. Herein lies an opportunity to extend the argument: while Sen's wariness of a universal list is understandable, mechanisms for capability selection in non-ideal circumstances remain underexplored (Robeyns 2005, p. 102).

# Nussbaum vs Sen: Finding a Middle Ground

In juxtaposition to Sen’s position, Nussbaum's advocacy for a concrete list, albeit open to context-specific adaptations, implies that without such guidance, the capability approach might be challenged to yield actionable insights in varying politic-cultural milieus. The balancing act between a rigid list and total flexibility posits a challenge that the capability approach must address to maintain relevance in practical applications (Robeyns 2005, p. 97).

# Addressing the Critique of Individualism

Furthermore, the critique that the capability approach is too individualistic is unfounded. The approach, upholding ethical individualism, does not deny societal influences on individuals. It incorporates societal structures and constraints into its considerations, especially in transformation abilities from commodities to functionings (Robeyns 2005, p. 107-108).

# Ensuring a Societal Context in Empirical Applications

While Robeyns' explanation clarifies these misunderstandings, highlighting the avenue to individually-centered yet societally contextual evaluations, the capability approach's resistance to methodological individualism may not be apparent in empirical applications. This illuminates an area for potential enhancement—ensuring that the approach's application does not unconsciously slip into methodological or ontological individualism, thus distorting the evaluations it intends to guide (Robeyns 2005, p. 108).

# The Practical Challenge of Operationalizing the Capability Approach

Ultimately, the capability approach interweaves aspirations of individual freedom with societal considerations; its challenge lies in operationalizing these intricate elements into an efficacious tool for policy-making. As Robeyns lays out the theoretical contours of this paradigm, the question looming large is how to translate its lofty aspirations into tangible impacts for society's diverse individuals (Robeyns 2005, p.110).

# Toward a More Nuanced and Practical Framework

To surmount this, a constructive amendment would involve a more nuanced approach to construct context-sensitive capability lists, guided by democratic deliberation and granular sociocultural understanding. This melds the flexibility Sen champions with the informed structure that Nussbaum prescribes, fostering an approach that is not only theoretically robust but practically grounded and responsive.
