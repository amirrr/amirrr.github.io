      <description>Nussbaum&amp;rsquo;s Response to Susan Okin 🔗In Martha Nussbaum&amp;rsquo;s paper &amp;ldquo;On Hearing Women&amp;rsquo;s Voices: A Reply to Susan Okin,&amp;rdquo; Nussbaum ardently defends her capabilities approach towards the attainment of justice for impoverished women against Okin’s critique. This paper intends to scrutinize the thread of Nussbaum’s justification of the capabilities approach and evaluate whether it responds effectively to Okin&amp;rsquo;s prime concerns on poor women&amp;rsquo;s voices.
Nussbaum&amp;rsquo;s capabilities approach, rooted in the notion of human dignity, promotes a list of ten basic entitlements intrinsic to living a life that fulfills human dignity (Nussbaum, pp.</description>

      <description>Introduction to the Capability Approach 🔗The capability approach, as explicated by Ingrid Robeyns, unfolds as an evaluative framework emphasizing what people are able to be and do (Robeyns 2005). It contrasts starkly with welfarist and utility-based paradigms by concentrating on individuals&amp;rsquo; capabilities and functionings rather than their happiness or material possessions. This normative viewpoint derives from influential work by Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum, each infusing the approach with different emphases and objectives—Sen with a focus on freedoms and functionings, and Nussbaum advocating for a distinct list of essential capabilities (Robeyns 2005).</description>

      <description>Equality Theories Explored by Amartya Sen 🔗In his paper &amp;ldquo;Equality of What?&amp;rdquo; by Amartya Sen, he delves into three different conceptions of equality, examining their strengths and limitations while proposing an alternative formulation termed &amp;ldquo;basic capability equality.&amp;rdquo; Sen presents this framework as a more nuanced and comprehensive approach to the concept of equality.
I. Methodological Approaches to Critiquing Equality [217, 198] 🔗Sen begins by discussing two distinct methodological approaches, the case-implication critique and the prior-principle critique, to evaluate and analyze moral claims associated with different conceptions of equality.</description>
