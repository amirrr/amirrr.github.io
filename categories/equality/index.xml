      <description>Introduction to the Capability Approach ðŸ”—The capability approach, as explicated by Ingrid Robeyns, unfolds as an evaluative framework emphasizing what people are able to be and do (Robeyns 2005). It contrasts starkly with welfarist and utility-based paradigms by concentrating on individuals&amp;rsquo; capabilities and functionings rather than their happiness or material possessions. This normative viewpoint derives from influential work by Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum, each infusing the approach with different emphases and objectivesâ€”Sen with a focus on freedoms and functionings, and Nussbaum advocating for a distinct list of essential capabilities (Robeyns 2005).</description>
